# Building Machine Learning Microservices for Music Generation

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/ramonpzg/synthetic_data_workshop)

## Description

This workshop focuses on building synthetic data generation using a variety of tools, including machine learning. In 
addition, we also cover how to microservices for different uses cases with the help of synthetic data. To follow 
along, please go over the Set Up instructions below.

## Objectives

By the end of the workshop, you will be able to
- create different fake, semi-fake, and creative datasets
- build user interfaces for your applications
- connect different models together
- understand what synthetic data generators are and how to tweak them

## Assumptions about the Learner

1. At least a year of experience coding
2. Knows how to use virtual environments
3. Does not mind using jupyter notebooks ðŸ˜Ž

## Ideal set up for the full workshop
- You will need to have `ffmpeg` and `docker` installed
- At least 15GB of disk space available
- At least 16 GB of memory ram available

For linux
```sh
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

For Mac
```sh
brew install ffmpeg
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

#### First Step

Open up your terminal and navigate to a directory of your choosing in your computer. Once there, run the following command to get the code for the session.

```sh
 git clone https://github.com/ramonpzg/synthetic_data_workshop.git
```

Conversely, you can click on the green `download` button at the top and download all
files to your desired folder/directory. Once you download it, unzip it and move on
to the second step.

#### Second Step

To get all dependencies, packages and everything else that would be useful in this
tutorial, you can recreate the environment by first going into the directory for today.

```sh
cd synthetic_data_workshop
```

Then you will need to create an environment with all of the dependencies needed for the session by running the following command.

```sh
mamba create -n ml_synth python=3.11
mamba activate ml_synth
pip install -r requirements.txt

## OR

conda create -n ml_synth python=3.11
conda activate ml_synth
pip install -r requirements.txt

## OR

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Third Step

Open up Jupyter Lab and you should be ready to go.

```sh
code .

## OR
# pip install jupyterlab
jupyter lab
```

You're all set. Now navigate to `notebooks/` directory and open the `00_intro.ipynb` notebook.
