    "In this part of the workshop, we'll learn about how to get started creating web applications that we'll later fill in with \n",
    "generated data to create a proof of concept, or maybe even the real deal. Before we begin though, let's talk about what \n",
    "microservices are and how to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are microservices?**\n",
    "Microservices are an architectural approach to building applications as a collection of small and modular, \n",
    "independently deployable services.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are machine learning microservices?**\n",
    "Machine learning microservices apply this approach to ML systems by decomposing them into smaller \n",
    "services that each focus on a specific capability or model. Some examples of machine learning microservices:\n",
    "- Model Training Service - Handles training ML models on new data.\n",
    "- Model Serving Service - Deploys trained models and provides predictions/inferences. \n",
    "- Data Processing Pipeline - Microservices for data ingestion, cleaning, preprocessing.\n",
    "- Model Monitoring Service - Tracks model performance and drift.\n",
    "- Experiment Tracking Service - Logs model experiments and results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of using microservices for machine learning include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Independent scaling - Can allocate more resources to demanding services.\n",
    "- Fault isolation - If one service fails, others are not affected.\n",
    "- Flexible deployment - Can rapidly deploy updates to individual services.\n",
    "- Polyglot support - Mix languages/frameworks within services.\n",
    "- Organizational alignment - Teams can own discrete services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenges are the added complexity of distributed systems and the need for coordination \n",
    "between services. Clear communication protocols and well-defined APIs are essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, microservices enable faster iteration and more robust and resilient ML systems, but require \n",
    "more up-front design and infrastructure coordination.\n",

    "Here's an attempt to describe the front-end and back-end of a microservices application using analogies:\n",
    "\n",
    "The front-end is like a traveler exploring a foreign city, navigating between sites and activities. It \n",
    "acts as the user interface, calling different services to assemble experiences. The React/Vue UI is the \n",
    "traveler's map, guiding them between locations. Redux/Flux stores are travel journals, recording visits \n",
    "to services. APIs are transit systems, with protocols like GraphQL as subway maps. User auth is visa \n",
    "security, granting access privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The back-end is like a bustling marketplace, full of vendors running independent shops. Services are \n",
    "merchant stalls, focused on specific capabilities. Data pipelines act as supply chains, moving inventory \n",
    "between stalls. Monitoring services are the market inspector, checking goods and stall conditions. APIs are \n",
    "the signboards and directions that connect the marketplace. Scaling changes the number of vendor stalls. New \n",
    "capabilities are added by launching new pop-up shops.\n",
    "\n",
    "To travel the market (use the app), the front-end explorer (UI) relies on the directions (APIs) to visit \n",
    "the right merchants (services). Back-end organization and protocols enable smooth exploration. Microservices \n",
    "create a thriving software bazaar!\n",

    "When testing your FastAPI app with pytest, you can write various types of tests to ensure that \n",
    "different aspects of your application are working correctly. Here are some types of tests you can consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unit Tests:**\n",
    "   - Test individual functions or methods in isolation to ensure they work as expected.\n",
    "   - For example, you can test the function that fetches jokes from the `pyjokes` library to ensure it returns valid jokes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integration Tests:**\n",
    "   - Test the interactions between different components of your app.\n",
    "   - For FastAPI apps, this can involve testing how different endpoints interact and whether the data flow between them is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Endpoint Tests:**\n",
    "   - Test each endpoint of your API to ensure they handle various input scenarios correctly and return the expected responses.\n",
    "   - Use pytest fixtures to mock HTTP requests and test different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and request payloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling Tests:**\n",
    "   - Test how your app handles different types of errors, such as invalid requests or server errors.\n",
    "   - Ensure that appropriate error responses (with correct status codes and error messages) are returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Security Tests:**\n",
    "   - Test security features, such as authentication and authorization mechanisms.\n",
    "   - Ensure that unauthenticated users cannot access protected endpoints and that authorized users can access them appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Performance Tests:**\n",
    "   - Test the performance of your app by simulating a large number of requests and measuring response times.\n",
    "   - Identify potential bottlenecks and optimize your code or infrastructure as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Edge Case Tests:**\n",
    "   - Test your app with edge cases, such as empty inputs, boundary values, or unexpected data formats.\n",
    "   - Ensure your app behaves correctly and gracefully in these scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Data Persistence Tests (if applicable):**\n",
    "   - If your app interacts with a database, test database operations (e.g., CRUD operations) to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "   - Use fixtures to set up and tear down test data for database-related tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing tests, consider using pytest fixtures to create reusable setup code for your tests. Also, \n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Unit Tests:**\n",

    "# utils.py\n",

    "\n",
    "def get_random_joke():\n",
    "    return pyjokes.get_joke()\n",
    "```\n",

    "# test_utils.py\n",
    "from utils import get_random_joke\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integration Tests:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For integration tests, you can test the interactions between different components of your app. Here's an example using FastAPI's `TestClient`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# test_integration.py\n",
    "from fastapi.testclient import TestClient\n",

    "\n",
    "# Add more error handling tests as needed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Security Tests:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Test authentication and authorization mechanisms (assuming your app has authentication logic):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# test_security.py\n",
    "from fastapi.testclient import TestClient\n",
    "from main import app\n",
